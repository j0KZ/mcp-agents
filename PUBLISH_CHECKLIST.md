## Pre-Publish Commands

Run these commands before publishing:

```bash
# 1. Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# 2. Run tests
npm test

# 3. Check coverage
npm run test:coverage:check

# 4. Build all packages
npm run build

# 5. Run security audit
npm audit

# 6. Check for secrets (using the security scanner)
npx @j0kz/security-scanner-mcp scan-project .

# 7. Verify version sync
npm run version:check-shared
```

## Publishing Steps

### For npm Publishing:

```bash
# 1. Login to npm
npm login

# 2. Publish all packages (except shared)
npm run publish-all

# 3. Verify on npm
# Check https://www.npmjs.com/~j0kz
```

### For GitHub:

```bash
# 1. Ensure all changes committed
git status

# 2. Create release tag
git tag v1.0.31
git push origin v1.0.31

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 4. Create GitHub Release
# Go to https://github.com/j0kz/mcp-agents/releases
```

## Security Verification

### Files that should NEVER be committed:
- `.env` or `.env.*`
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.crt`
- `credentials.json`, `auth.json`
- Database files (`*.db`, `*.sqlite`)
- `node_modules/`
- Personal configuration files

### Files that SHOULD be included:
- `README.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `package.json`
- `dist/` directories (for npm packages)

## Final Checks

- [ ] No console.log in production code (except CLI tools)
- [ ] No TODO comments with sensitive information
- [ ] No commented-out code with credentials
- [ ] All dependencies up to date
- [ ] No vulnerable dependencies (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Version numbers synchronized
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated

## Post-Publish Verification

After publishing:
1. Install packages in a clean directory
2. Verify functionality with basic tests
3. Check package size on npm
4. Monitor for security advisories

**Remember**: When in doubt, don't publish. It's better to be safe than sorry!
