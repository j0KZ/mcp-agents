# Best Practices

Expert tips and best practices for using MCP Agents effectively.

## General Principles

### 1. Start Small, Scale Up

‚ùå **Don't**: Install all 8 tools and try to use everything at once

‚úÖ **Do**: Start with 1-2 tools that solve your biggest pain points
```
Week 1: Test Generator
Week 2: Add Security Scanner
Week 3: Add Smart Reviewer
```

### 2. Provide Context

‚ùå **Don't**: "Review my code"

‚úÖ **Do**: "Review UserService.ts - it's an Express.js API service using MongoDB. Focus on security and performance."

### 3. Iterate and Refine

‚ùå **Don't**: Accept first output, move on

‚úÖ **Do**: Review output, provide feedback, iterate
```
"Generate tests for calculator.js"
‚Üí Review output
"Add more edge cases for division by zero"
‚Üí Better results
```

## Tool-Specific Best Practices

### Test Generator

‚úÖ **Best Practices**:
- Generate tests WHILE writing code, not after
- Review and customize generated tests
- Use as a starting point, not final solution
- Combine with manual tests for complex logic

```javascript
// Good: Generate baseline, then enhance
const baseTests = generateTests('user.js');
// Add your domain-specific edge cases
// Add integration tests
// Add performance tests
```

‚ùå **Anti-patterns**:
- Generating tests for legacy code without understanding it
- Blindly committing generated tests
- Skipping test review

### Smart Reviewer

‚úÖ **Best Practices**:
- Run before creating PR
- Address critical/high issues immediately
- Discuss medium/low issues with team
- Use as learning tool

```
// Good workflow:
1. Write code
2. Self-review with Smart Reviewer
3. Fix critical issues
4. Create PR
5. Team review
```

‚ùå **Anti-patterns**:
- Ignoring all suggestions
- Arguing with every suggestion without considering it
- Not providing context about project standards

### API Designer

‚úÖ **Best Practices**:
- Design API before writing code
- Generate OpenAPI spec for documentation
- Use generated mocks for frontend development
- Validate design with team

```
// Good: API-first workflow
1. Design API
2. Generate spec
3. Review with team
4. Generate mock server
5. Frontend starts work
6. Backend implements spec
```

‚ùå **Anti-patterns**:
- Designing API after writing code
- Not versioning APIs
- Skipping authentication/authorization design

### Database Schema Designer

‚úÖ **Best Practices**:
- Start with plain text requirements
- Review generated schema for normalization
- Add custom indexes based on query patterns
- Generate ER diagrams for documentation

```
// Good: Schema workflow
1. Write requirements
2. Generate schema
3. Review normalization
4. Optimize indexes
5. Generate migration
6. Generate ER diagram
7. Review with team
```

‚ùå **Anti-patterns**:
- Over-normalizing (6NF when 3NF is fine)
- Skipping indexes
- Not planning for scale

### Refactor Assistant

‚úÖ **Best Practices**:
- Generate tests BEFORE refactoring
- Refactor incrementally
- Run tests after each change
- Review complexity metrics

```javascript
// Good: Safe refactoring
1. Generate tests for current code
2. Verify tests pass
3. Refactor one thing at a time
4. Run tests after each change
5. Review with Smart Reviewer
```

‚ùå **Anti-patterns**:
- Massive refactoring without tests
- Applying design patterns unnecessarily
- Refactoring without understanding

### Security Scanner

‚úÖ **Best Practices**:
- Scan on every commit
- Fix critical issues immediately
- Track and prioritize medium/low issues
- Combine with dependency scanning

```yaml
# Good: CI/CD integration
on: [push, pull_request]
  - Scan for vulnerabilities
  - Fail if critical/high found
  - Report medium/low
```

‚ùå **Anti-patterns**:
- Scanning only before release
- Ignoring "false positives" without review
- Not fixing vulnerabilities

### Architecture Analyzer

‚úÖ **Best Practices**:
- Run regularly (weekly)
- Track metrics over time
- Fix circular dependencies early
- Enforce layer boundaries

```javascript
// Good: Track trends
{
  "2025-09-01": { circular: 2, complexity: 45 },
  "2025-10-01": { circular: 1, complexity: 42 }, // Improving!
}
```

‚ùå **Anti-patterns**:
- Analyzing once and never again
- Ignoring "God classes"
- Allowing layer violations

### Documentation Generator

‚úÖ **Best Practices**:
- Generate docs as you code
- Review and enhance generated docs
- Keep docs close to code (JSDoc)
- Update docs when code changes

```javascript
// Good: Keep docs updated
1. Write function
2. Generate JSDoc
3. Review and customize
4. Commit together
```

‚ùå **Anti-patterns**:
- Generating all docs at the end
- Never updating generated docs
- Auto-generated docs with no review

## Workflow Best Practices

### Code Review Workflow

```
1. Smart Reviewer (self-review)
2. Fix critical issues
3. Security Scanner
4. Fix vulnerabilities
5. Generate/update tests
6. Generate/update docs
7. Create PR
8. Team review
```

### Feature Development Workflow

```
1. API Designer (design endpoints)
2. DB Schema Designer (design schema)
3. Generate documentation
4. Test Generator (TDD - write tests first)
5. Implement code
6. Refactor Assistant (clean up)
7. Smart Reviewer (review)
8. Security Scanner (scan)
9. Architecture Analyzer (check for issues)
```

### Legacy Code Workflow

```
1. Architecture Analyzer (understand structure)
2. Security Scanner (find vulnerabilities)
3. Test Generator (add test coverage)
4. Refactor Assistant (modernize code)
5. Smart Reviewer (verify improvements)
6. Re-scan security
```

## Team Best Practices

### 1. Shared Configuration

Create team-wide configs:
```javascript
// .mcprc.js (version controlled)
export default {
  testGenerator: {
    framework: 'vitest',
    coverage: 80
  },
  smartReviewer: {
    severity: {
      security: 'error',
      performance: 'warning'
    }
  },
  securityScanner: {
    failOn: ['critical', 'high']
  }
};
```

### 2. Consistent Standards

Document team decisions:
```markdown
# Team MCP Guidelines

## Test Generator
- Minimum 80% coverage
- Always include edge cases
- Review generated tests

## Smart Reviewer
- Address all critical issues
- Discuss high issues in PR
- Medium/low are optional
```

### 3. CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# Required checks:
- Security scan (fail on critical/high)
- Test coverage (minimum 80%)
- Architecture check (no new circular deps)
```

## Performance Best Practices

### 1. Parallel Processing

```bash
# Good: Process files in parallel
for file in src/**/*.js; do
  (scan-file $file &)
done
wait

# Bad: Sequential processing
for file in src/**/*.js; do
  scan-file $file
done
```

### 2. Incremental Updates

```bash
# Good: Only scan changed files
git diff --name-only | xargs security-scanner

# Bad: Scan entire project every time
security-scanner scan src/
```

### 3. Caching

```javascript
// Good: Cache scan results
if (fileUnchanged && resultsCached) {
  return cachedResults;
}
```

## Quality Best Practices

### 1. Review All Generated Code

Never blindly commit generated code:
- Read it
- Understand it
- Test it
- Customize it if needed

### 2. Combine Human + AI

```
AI: Generate 80% of tests
Human: Add 20% domain-specific tests
Result: Comprehensive test suite
```

### 3. Learn from Suggestions

```
Smart Reviewer: "This function has complexity 15"
You: Learn about cyclomatic complexity
You: Refactor to reduce complexity
Result: Better developer
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Over-automation

‚ùå Automating everything, losing understanding
‚úÖ Automate repetitive tasks, stay engaged

### 2. Ignoring Context

‚ùå "This is a false positive" (without checking)
‚úÖ "Let me verify this is actually safe"

### 3. Tool Dependency

‚ùå Can't code without tools
‚úÖ Tools enhance skills, not replace them

### 4. No Human Review

‚ùå Auto-commit generated code
‚úÖ Always review before committing

### 5. Wrong Tool for Job

‚ùå Using Test Generator for integration tests
‚úÖ Use for unit tests, write integration tests manually

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics:

```javascript
{
  // Before MCP Agents
  testCoverage: 45%,
  securityIssues: 23,
  timeToFeature: '2 weeks',
  codeReviewTime: '2 hours',

  // After 3 months
  testCoverage: 85%,      // +40%
  securityIssues: 2,      // -91%
  timeToFeature: '1 week', // -50%
  codeReviewTime: '30min'  // -75%
}
```

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Weekly**: Review tool usage, adjust configs
2. **Monthly**: Update team guidelines based on learnings
3. **Quarterly**: Evaluate new tools/features
4. **Yearly**: Measure impact, celebrate wins

## Getting Help

- üìñ Read tool-specific documentation
- üí¨ Ask in GitHub discussions
- üêõ Report issues with clear examples
- ü§ù Share your workflows with community

## Final Tips

1. **Be Patient**: Learning curve is normal
2. **Start Simple**: Master basics before advanced features
3. **Share Knowledge**: Help teammates learn
4. **Provide Feedback**: Help improve tools
5. **Have Fun**: Tools should make coding enjoyable!
