## When to Create Logs

**Create a work log when:**
- Building new research/experimental code
- Creating proof-of-concept implementations
- Developing features that span multiple files
- Working on anything not immediately committed to git

**Don't create logs for:**
- Simple bug fixes (1-2 line changes)
- Routine maintenance tasks
- Documentation-only updates
