# Audit vs Roadmap Comparison - October 6, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding:** The ROADMAP and TODO contain **significantly outdated metrics** that don't match the current audit findings. Multiple discrepancies found in test counts, coverage percentages, and completion status.

### Comparison Grade: **D (Needs Major Updates)**

---

## 1. Test Count Discrepancies ⚠️

### ROADMAP Claims vs. Audit Reality

| Metric             | ROADMAP/TODO Says | Audit Found     | Discrepancy              |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Total Tests**    | 853 tests         | **713 tests**   | ❌ -140 tests (-16%)     |
| **Test Expansion** | 625 → 853 (+228)  | 625 → 713 (+88) | ❌ Inflated by 140 tests |

### Where the Discrepancy Comes From

**ROADMAP.md Line 8:**

```markdown
- All 9 MCP tools published and stable (including orchestrator-mcp)
- **853 passing tests** across all packages (100% pass rate)
```

**TODO.md Line 19:**

```markdown
- [x] **853 tests across 9 packages** (100% pass rate), verified October 5, 2025 ✨ **v1.0.31**
```

**Audit Reality (verified Oct 6, 2025):**

```
Test Files: 42 passed (42)
Tests:      713 passed (713)
```

**Root Cause:** The ROADMAP was updated on October 5 claiming 853 tests were "verified", but this appears to be from an older measurement or includes tests that were later removed/consolidated.

---

## 2. Coverage Metrics Misalignment ⚠️

### Coverage Claims vs. Reality

| Metric             | ROADMAP Says            | Audit Found                  | Status                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Statements**     | 60-62% (various claims) | **61.69%**                   | ✅ Close match         |
| **Branches**       | 67%                     | **76.00%**                   | ⚠️ Underreported by 9% |
| **Functions**      | 74-75%                  | **74.63%**                   | ✅ Match               |
| **Overall Status** | "60% coverage target"   | 61.69% exceeds 55% threshold | ✅ Good                |

**Note:** Coverage metrics are more accurate than test counts, likely because they're auto-generated from vitest output.

---

## 3. Completion Status Discrepancies

### Phase Completion Claims

**ROADMAP Says (Lines 20-29):**

```markdown
- **Phase 2: Quality & Test Coverage** (v1.0.31)
  - Test coverage expansion (+228 tests, 625 → 853)

- **Phase 3: Performance & Optimization** (v1.0.31)
  - Performance: 2.18x speedup with caching (99.9% hit rate)
```

**Audit Reality:**

- ✅ Phase 2 partially complete (coverage increased, but test count is 713, not 853)
- ✅ Phase 3 complete (caching implemented, 2.18x speedup verified)
- ❌ Test expansion is 88 tests (+14%), not 228 tests (+36.5%)

---

## 4. Package Coverage Claims

### TODO.md Claims (Lines 35-45)

**TODO Says:**

```markdown
- api-designer: 140 tests
- refactor-assistant: 311 tests
- security-scanner: 64 tests
- smart-reviewer: 100 tests (analyzers coverage 0% → 100%)
- test-generator: 85 tests (added AST cache tests)
- orchestrator-mcp: 17 tests
```

**Audit Reality:**
Cannot verify individual package test counts from audit, but total doesn't add up:

- 140 + 311 + 64 + 100 + 85 + 17 = 717 tests (just from these 6 packages)
- But total is only 713 tests across ALL 11 packages
- **Clear inconsistency** ❌

---

## 5. What's Accurate in ROADMAP/TODO ✅

### These Claims Match Audit Findings:

1. **Security** ✅
   - ROADMAP: "Zero vulnerabilities"
   - Audit: 100/100 security score, 0 vulnerabilities
   - **Match:** Perfect

2. **Architecture** ✅
   - ROADMAP: "Modular architecture"
   - Audit: 0 circular dependencies
   - **Match:** Perfect

3. **Code Quality Improvements** ✅
   - ROADMAP: "Security Scanner: 57→100/100"
   - Audit: Confirmed 100/100 score
   - **Match:** Perfect

4. **Performance** ✅
   - ROADMAP: "2.18x speedup with caching"
   - Audit: Verified in benchmark results
   - **Match:** Perfect

5. **Pass Rate** ✅
   - ROADMAP: "100% pass rate"
   - Audit: 713/713 tests passing
   - **Match:** Perfect

---

## 6. Critical Issues in Documentation

### Issue 1: Outdated Test Counts

**Problem:** ROADMAP.md claims 853 tests across multiple locations, but actual count is 713.

**Lines to Fix:**

- ROADMAP.md:8 - "853 passing tests" → "713 passing tests"
- ROADMAP.md:24 - "625 → 853 (+228 tests)" → "625 → 713 (+88 tests)"
- ROADMAP.md:58 - "Tests: 625 → 853 (+36.5%, +228 tests)" → "Tests: 625 → 713 (+14%, +88 tests)"
- TODO.md:19 - "853 tests across 9 packages" → "713 tests across 9 packages"
- TODO.md:38 - "853 total tests verified" → "713 total tests verified"
- TODO.md:769 - "added 228 tests, 625 → 853" → "added 88 tests, 625 → 713"

### Issue 2: Individual Package Test Counts Don't Add Up

**Problem:** TODO.md lists per-package test counts that sum to more than the total.

**Lines to Fix:**

- TODO.md:40-45 - Individual package test counts need verification
- Either the individual counts are wrong, or the total is wrong

### Issue 3: Inconsistent "Last Updated" Dates

**ROADMAP.md:**

- Line 2: "Last Updated: October 2025" (no specific date)
- Line 754: "Last Major Update: October 5, 2025"

**TODO.md:**

- Line 3: "Last Updated: October 5, 2025"

**Audit Date:** October 6, 2025

**Recommendation:** Update to "Last Updated: October 6, 2025" after fixes.

## 7. Strategic Alignment (Goals vs. Reality)

### Roadmap Priorities vs. Audit Recommendations

| Roadmap Priority         | Audit Recommendation                                       | Alignment             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Configuration Wizard     | Not mentioned                                              | ❌ Missing from audit |
| Performance Profiler MCP | Not critical in audit                                      | ⚠️ Misaligned         |
| Migration Assistant MCP  | Not mentioned                                              | ❌ Missing            |
| **Refactor complexity**  | **Critical: Reduce complexity in refactor-assistant (71)** | ✅ **ALIGNED**        |
| Enhanced docs            | Add JSDoc to public APIs                                   | ✅ Aligned            |
| Test coverage expansion  | Increase coverage to 80%+                                  | ✅ Aligned            |
| Workflow engine          | Already complete (orchestrator-mcp)                        | ✅ Complete           |

### Audit's Critical Recommendations NOT in Roadmap:

1. **Refactor refactor-assistant** (Complexity 71 → <50)
   - **Missing from ROADMAP** ❌
   - Should be **Priority 1** based on audit

2. **Simplify test-generator** (Complexity 56 → <40)
   - **Missing from ROADMAP** ❌
   - Should be **Priority 2** based on audit

3. **Standardize MCP SDK version** (^1.18.2 vs ^1.19.1)
   - **Missing from ROADMAP** ❌
   - Quick win for consistency

4. **Add JSDoc to public APIs**
   - Mentioned in "Enhanced Documentation" but not prioritized
   - Audit says this is **High Priority**

---

## 8. What ROADMAP Gets Right ✅

### Accurate Forward-Looking Plans:

1. **New MCPs (Vector 2):**
   - Performance Profiler, Migration Assistant, Accessibility Auditor
   - Not contradicted by audit
   - Future-focused ✅

2. **Advanced Integration (Vector 3):**
   - Event bus, shared state management
   - These are good ideas for future ✅

3. **Developer Experience (Vector 4):**
   - Configuration wizard, plugin system
   - Valid future priorities ✅

4. **Completed Work Accurately Documented:**
   - CI/CD Templates ✅
   - Smart Reviewer Auto-Fix ✅
   - Phase 1-3 quality improvements ✅
   - MCP Workflow Engine (orchestrator) ✅

## 12. Conclusion

### Summary

The ROADMAP and TODO documents are **strategically sound** but contain **significant factual errors** in metrics:

**What's Wrong:**

- ❌ Test count is inflated by 140 tests (20% error)
- ❌ Individual package test counts don't add up
- ❌ Test expansion claims are inflated (228 vs 88 actual)
- ❌ Missing critical audit-driven priorities

**What's Right:**

- ✅ Security posture accurately described (100/100)
- ✅ Architecture quality correct (0 circular deps)
- ✅ Phase 1-3 improvements accurately documented
- ✅ Performance gains verified (2.18x speedup)
- ✅ Strategic vision is sound

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix test count (853 → 713) across all docs
2. **Today:** Add audit-driven priorities to ROADMAP
3. **This Week:** Reconcile per-package test counts
4. **This Sprint:** Implement audit recommendations (refactor complexity)

### Final Verdict

**The roadmap is directionally correct but numerically wrong.** Fix the metrics, add audit priorities, and the project will have excellent alignment between documentation and reality.
