# Documentation Update - October 6, 2025

## Summary

Updated all documentation to fix test count discrepancies discovered in the comprehensive audit. All metrics now accurately reflect the verified project state as of October 6, 2025.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Test Counts (853 → 713)

**Files Updated:**

- ✅ [docs/architecture/ROADMAP.md](../architecture/ROADMAP.md) - 6 locations
- ✅ [docs/TODO.md](../TODO.md) - 4 locations
- ✅ [README.md](../../README.md) - Already correct
- ✅ [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) - Already correct

**Changed From:** 853 passing tests
**Changed To:** 713 passing tests
**Reason:** Audit verification showed actual count is 713 tests (100% pass rate)

### 2. Fixed Test Expansion Claims

**Changed From:** +228 tests (625 → 853, +36.5%)
**Changed To:** +88 tests (625 → 713, +14%)

**Locations Fixed:**

- ROADMAP.md lines 8, 24, 47, 58
- TODO.md lines 19, 38, 765, 779

### 3. Added Audit-Driven Priorities to ROADMAP

Added new **"Critical - Code Quality"** section with 4 priorities from Oct 6 audit:

#### P0-1: Refactor refactor-assistant complexity

- Current: Complexity 71, Maintainability 16
- Target: Complexity <50, Maintainability >30
- Estimated: 2-3 days

#### P0-2: Simplify test-generator

- Current: Complexity 56, Maintainability 29
- Target: Complexity <40, Maintainability >35
- Estimated: 1-2 days

#### P0-3: Standardize MCP SDK versions

- Mixed ^1.18.2 and ^1.19.1
- Target: All packages use ^1.19.1
- Estimated: 30 minutes

#### P0-4: Add JSDoc to public APIs

- Use doc-generator MCP
- Focus on exported functions
- Estimated: 1-2 days

### 4. Updated "Last Updated" Dates

**Files Updated:**

- ROADMAP.md: "October 2025" → "October 6, 2025"
- TODO.md: "October 5, 2025" → "October 6, 2025"

**Added Audit References:**

- ROADMAP.md: "Last Audit: October 6, 2025 - Overall Grade: A (93/100)"
- TODO.md: "Last Audit: October 6, 2025 - Grade: A (93/100)"

### 5. Removed Individual Package Test Counts

**Removed from TODO.md (lines 40-45):**

```markdown
- api-designer: 140 tests
- refactor-assistant: 311 tests
- security-scanner: 64 tests
- smart-reviewer: 100 tests
- test-generator: 85 tests
- orchestrator-mcp: 17 tests
```

**Replaced With:**

```markdown
- Test expansion: +88 tests from baseline (625 → 713)
```

**Reason:** Individual counts summed to 717 (impossible when total is 713)

### 6. Updated Coverage Metrics

**Changed in TODO.md:**

- From: "62% statements, 67% branches, 75% functions"
- To: "61.69% statements, 76% branches, 74.63% functions"

**Reason:** Match verified audit metrics exactly
