## Next Steps - Phase 2-5 Recommendations

### Phase 2: Complexity Reduction (Deferred)

**Decision:** Defer to future sprint
**Reason:** Requires significant refactoring with moderate risk
**Alternative:** Focus on safer, high-impact improvements first

### Phase 3: Code Quality (Recommended Next)

**Priority:** HIGH | Risk: LOW
**Tasks:**

1. Add missing constants for magic numbers (78 instances)
2. Fix nested ternaries (8 instances) - low risk
3. Break long lines (10 instances) - cosmetic only
   **Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
   **Expected Impact:** Reduce code issues by 95 â†’ ~20

### Phase 4: Test Coverage (Critical)

**Priority:** CRITICAL | Risk: LOW
**Focus Areas:**

1. **db-schema generators** (4.68% â†’ 60%+) - 12-15 tests needed
2. **security-scanner secret detection** (0% â†’ 80%+) - 8-10 tests needed
3. **refactor-assistant metrics** (4.76% â†’ 70%+) - 6-8 tests needed
4. **doc-generator functions** (26.95% â†’ 60%+) - 8-10 tests needed

**Target:** Bring average coverage from 46.6% â†’ 70%+
**Estimated Tests to Add:** ~50-60 new tests
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

### Phase 5: Validation

**Tasks:**

1. Re-run full audit
2. Generate metrics comparison
3. Update documentation
4. Create PR with detailed changelog

   - db-schema generators (critical gap)
   - security-scanner secret detection (security critical)

### Future Sprint

1. **Phase 2:** Complexity reduction
   - Requires careful planning
   - Extract large functions (api-designer: 114, refactor-assistant: 84, db-schema: 83)
   - Target: Reduce average complexity 70.5 â†’ <60

2. **Phase 4 (Complete):** Full coverage expansion
   - Bring all packages to 80%+ coverage
   - Add integration tests
   - Edge case coverage
