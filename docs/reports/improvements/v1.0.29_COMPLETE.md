## 🚀 CI/CD Infrastructure

### Coverage Enforcement

**Created Files:**

- `scripts/check-coverage.js` - Automated validation script
- `scripts/coverage-dashboard.js` - Visual reporting
- `.github/secret_scanning.yml` - Security config

**Vitest Configuration Updates:**

```typescript
coverage: {
  thresholds: {
    statements: 60,  // 60% minimum
    branches: 50,    // 50% minimum
    functions: 60,   // 60% minimum
    lines: 60,       // 60% minimum
  },
  perFile: true,
  exclude: [
    'node_modules/**',
    'dist/**',
    '**/*.test.ts',
    '**/mcp-server.ts',
  ]
}
```

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**

- Removed `continue-on-error: true` from test steps
- Added coverage enforcement step
- Fails builds below thresholds
- Only runs on Node 20.x for consistency

**Impact:**

- ✅ Strict quality gates prevent regression
- ✅ Automated validation on every PR
- ✅ Visual dashboard for coverage tracking
- ✅ Enforces minimum quality standards

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

### GitHub Secret Scanning Resolution

**Problem:**

- Initial test fixtures used realistic-looking patterns
- GitHub push protection blocked commits
- Security scanners flagged test files

**Solution:**

- Replaced all realistic patterns with obviously fake ones
- Used repeated characters: `'AKIA' + 'X'.repeat(16)`
- Patterns still match regex for testing
- Zero entropy, impossible to be real secrets

**Examples:**

```typescript
// Before (blocked):
'AKIA[realistic-looking-pattern]'; // Looked like real AWS key
'ghp_[realistic-pattern]'; // Looked like real GitHub token

// After (allowed):
'AKIA' + 'X'.repeat(16); // Obviously fake: AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
'ghp_' + 'X'.repeat(36); // Obviously fake: all X's
'sk_live_' + 'Z'.repeat(24); // Obviously fake: all Z's
```

**Result:**

- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No GitHub security alerts
- ✅ Patterns still validate scanner functionality
- ✅ Production-ready compliance
