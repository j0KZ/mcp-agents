## Known Limitations

### Test Quality
- Most tests are "smoke tests" that verify structure but not logic
- Missing edge case coverage
- No snapshot testing for generators
- No fixture files for security scanner
- Limited integration tests

**See [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for improvement roadmap**

### Coverage Gaps
- Statement coverage still low (14.09% vs 55% target)
- Many advanced features in shared package untested
- Missing property-based tests
- Missing performance tests

---

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. **Improve Test Quality** (Week 1-2)
   - Rewrite security-scanner tests with real vulnerability fixtures
   - Add snapshot testing to api-designer
   - Add fixture files to test-generator

2. **Increase Coverage** (Week 3-4)
   - Add integration tests
   - Add property-based tests with fast-check
   - Test shared package utilities

3. **Add CI/CD** (Week 5)
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated testing on PR
   - Coverage reporting
