## 🌍 What Are Universal Skills?

These are **project-agnostic skills** that work in ANY codebase, regardless of:

- **Programming language** (JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, etc.)
- **Framework** (React, Django, Spring, Rails, etc.)
- **Project type** (Web, API, CLI, Mobile, Desktop)
- **MCP tools** (Enhanced with MCP, but work without)

Each skill provides:

- ✅ **WITH MCP**: Automated solutions using MCP tools
- ✅ **WITHOUT MCP**: Manual approaches and commands
- ✅ **Language-agnostic** patterns and techniques
- ✅ **Universal best practices** that apply everywhere

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Using Skills WITH MCP Tools

If you have the MCP tools installed:

```bash
# Install MCP tools first (if not already)
npx @j0kz/mcp-agents@latest
```

Then use natural language:

```
"Run quick PR review on my staged changes"
"Find performance bottlenecks in my application"
"Generate tests to reach 80% coverage"
```

### Using Skills WITHOUT MCP Tools

Each skill includes complete manual approaches:

```bash
# Example: Quick PR review without MCP
git diff --staged            # Review changes
npm test                      # Run tests
npm run lint                  # Check linting
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME"        # Find incomplete work

# Example: Debug without MCP
console.log('🔍 Checkpoint 1');  # Add breadcrumbs
git bisect start              # Find breaking commit
```

## 💡 Performance Optimization (MCP Users)

All skills are optimized for context efficiency when using MCP tools:

### Response Format Options

- **`concise` (default, recommended):** 500 tokens per tool call
  - 90% faster than detailed mode
  - Perfect for daily workflow
  - Provides summary without full details

- **`minimal` (for batch operations):** 100 tokens per tool call
  - 98% faster than detailed mode
  - Ideal for quick checks and CI/CD
  - Returns only success/fail + key metrics

- **`detailed` (for deep investigation):** 5000 tokens per tool call
  - Complete analysis with all data
  - Use only when investigating specific issues
  - Not recommended for routine work

### How to Use

**Natural language:**
```
"Review this code using concise format"
"Scan for vulnerabilities using minimal format"
```

**Tool calls:**
```javascript
review_file({ filePath: "...", config: { response_format: "concise" } })
scan_file({ filePath: "...", config: { response_format: "minimal" } })
generate_tests({ sourceFile: "...", config: { response_format: "concise" } })
```

### Token Savings

| Operation | Default (detailed) | Concise | Minimal | Savings |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Single file review | 5000 tokens | 500 tokens | 100 tokens | **90-98%** |
| 3-tool workflow | 15,000 tokens | 1,500 tokens | 300 tokens | **90-98%** |
| Full project audit | 50,000 tokens | 5,000 tokens | 1,000 tokens | **90-98%** |

**Result:** Each skill invocation uses 10-50x fewer tokens while maintaining effectiveness!
